## Unitary Gates

They can be specified by giving a Clifford operator tableaux and the indices on which it acts
(particularly useful for gates acting on a small part of a circuit):

```@example 1
using QuantumClifford # hide
using QuantumClifford.Experimental.NoisyCircuits # hide
SparseGate(CNOT, [2,4])
```

The Clifford operator tableaux can be completely arbitrary.
```@example 1
SparseGate(random_clifford(3), [2,4,5])
```

If the Clifford operator acts on all qubits, we do not need to specify indices.
```@example 1
DenseGate(random_clifford(5))
```

## Noisy Gates

Each gate can be followed by noise applied to the qubits on which it has acted.
This is done by wrapping the given gate into a [`NoisyGate`](@ref)

```@example 1
ε = 0.03 # X/Y/Z error probability
noise = UnbiasedUncorrelatedNoise(ε)
noisy_gate = NoisyGate(SparseGate(CNOT, [2,4]), noise)
```

In circuit diagrams the noise is not depicted, but after each application of the gate defined in `noisy_gate`, a noise operator will also be applied. The example above is of Pauli Depolarization implemented by [`UnbiasedUncorrelatedNoise`](@ref).

One can also apply only the noise operator by using [`NoiseOp`](@ref) which acts only on specified qubits. Or alternatively, one can use [`NoiseOpAll`](@ref) in order to apply noise to all qubits.

```@example 1
[NoiseOp(noise, [4,5]), NoiseOpAll(noise)]
```

## Coincidence Measurements

Global parity measurements involving single-qubit projections and classical communication are implemented with [`BellMeasurement`](@ref). One needs to specify the axes of measurement and the qubits being measured. If the parity is trivial, the circuit continues, if the parity is non-trivial, the circuit ends and reports a detected failure.
This operator is frequently used in the simulation of entanglement purification.

```@example 1
BellMeasurement([X, Y, Z], [1,3,4])
```

There is also [`NoisyBellMeasurement`](@ref) that takes the bit-flip probability of a single-qubit measurement as a third argument.

## Stabilizer Measurements

A measurement over one or more qubits can also be performed, e.g., a direct stabilizer measurement on multiple qubits without the use of ancillary qubits. When applied to multiple qubits, this differs from `BellMeasurement` as it performs a single projection, unlike `BellMeasurement` which performs a separate projection for every single qubit involved. This measurement is implemented in [`DenseMeasurement`](@ref) which requires a Pauli operator on which to project and the index of the classical bit in which to store the result. Alternatively, there is [`SparseMeasurement`](@ref), which acts only on the subset of all qubits.

```@example 1
[DenseMeasurement(P"XYZ", 1), SparseMeasurement(P"Z", [2], 2), SparseMeasurement(P"XX", [1,3], 3)]
```

## Verification Operations

At the end of many circuits one might want to check whether they performed correctly. The [`VerifyOp`](@ref) operation corresponds to an unphysical perfect tomographic operation, checking whether the state of the qubits at the given indices is indeed what is expected. If it is, the operation reports a success, otherwise it reports an undetected error.

```@example 1
desired_state = random_stabilizer(5)
qubit_indices = [1,2,3,4,7]
VerifyOp(desired_state, qubit_indices)
```

## Gates Conditioned on Classical Bits


[`ConditionalGate`](@ref) is a conditional gate that performs one of two provided gates, depending on the value of a given classical bit.

[`DecisionGate`](@ref) is a conditional gate that performs one of the supplied `gates`, depending on the output of `decisionfunction` applied to the entire classical bit register.

```@example 1
gate1 = SparseGate(CNOT,   [1,2])
gate2 = SparseGate(CPHASE, [1,2])
gate3 = SparseGate(SWAP,   [1,3])
cg = ConditionalGate(gate1, gate2, 2)
dg = DecisionGate([gate1,gate2,gate3], bit_register->1) # it will always perform gate1
[SparseMeasurement(X,[4],1), SparseMeasurement(Z,[5],2), cg, dg]
```
