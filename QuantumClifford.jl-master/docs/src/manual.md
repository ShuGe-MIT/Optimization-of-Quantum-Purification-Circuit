# Pauli Operators

The [`PauliOperator`](@ref) object representes multi-qubit Pauli operator
(``±\{1,i\}\{I,Z,X,Y\}^{\otimes n}``). It is stored in memory as a phase (a
single byte where `0x0,0x1,0x2,0x3` corresponds to $1,i,-1,-i$) and two
bit-arrays, for X and for Z components.

You can create them with a `P` string.

```jldoctest
julia> P"-iXZ"
-iXZ
```

Or by specifying phase and X/Z components:

```jldoctest
julia> PauliOperator(0x0,Bool[0,1,0],Bool[0,0,1])
+ _XZ
```

Both underscore and I can be used for identity.

```jldoctest
julia> P"I_XYZ"
+ __XYZ
```

Multiplication with scalars or other Pauli operators works as expected, as well
as tensor products of Pauli operators.

```jldoctest
julia> -1im*P"X"
-iX

julia> P"X" * P"Z"
-iY

julia> P"X" ⊗ P"Z"
+ XZ
```

One can check for commutativity with [`comm`](@ref).

```jldoctest
julia> comm(P"X",P"Z")
0x01

julia> comm(P"XX",P"ZZ")
0x00
```

And check the phase of a product with [`prodphase`](@ref).

```jldoctest
julia> prodphase(P"X", P"Z")
0x03

julia> prodphase(P"X", P"iZ")
0x00

julia> prodphase(P"X",P"Y")
0x01
```

Indexing operations are available.

```jldoctest
julia> p = P"IXYZ";

julia> p[1], p[2], p[3], p[4]
((false, false), (true, false), (true, true), (false, true))

julia> p = P"III";

julia> p[2] = (true, true);

julia> p
+ _Y_
```

Including fancy indexing:

```jldoctest
julia> P"IXYZ"[[2,3]]
+ XY

julia> P"IXYZ"[[false,true,true,false]]
+ XY
```

The operator is represented in memory by bit arrays (much denser than using byte
arrays).

```jldoctest
julia> p = P"-IXYZ";

julia> p.nqubits, p.xz
(4, UInt64[0x0000000000000006, 0x000000000000000c])
```

Views that give just the X or Z components of the `xz` bitarray are available through [`xview`](@ref) and [`zview`](@ref).

```jldoctest
julia> xview(P"XYZI")
1-element view(::Vector{UInt64}, 1:1) with eltype UInt64:
 0x0000000000000003
```

The convenience methods [`xbit`](@ref) and [`zbit`](@ref) give you Bool (GF2) vectors.

```jldoctest
julia> xbit(P"XYZI")
4-element Vector{Bool}:
 1
 1
 0
 0
```

# [Stabilizers](@id Stabilizers)

A [`Stabilizer`](@ref) object is a tableau of Pauli operators. When the tableau is
meant to represent a (pure or mixed) stabilizer state, all of these operators
should commute (but that is not enforced, rather `Stabilizer` is a generic
tableau data structure). It is stored in memory as a phase list and a bit-matrix
for X and Z components. It can be instantiated by an `S` string, or with a
number of different constructors.

For data structures that build upon this tableau representation
to track other useful information, consider
[`Destabilizer`](@ref),
[`MixedStabilizer`](@ref),
and [`MixedDestabilizer`](@ref).
See also the [data structures discussion page](@ref Choosing-Appropriate-Data-Structure).

```jldoctest
julia> S"-XX
         +ZZ"
- XX
+ ZZ

julia> Stabilizer([P"-XX",P"+ZZ"])
- XX
+ ZZ

julia> Stabilizer([0x2, 0x0],
                  Bool[1 1;
                       0 0],
                  Bool[0 0;
                       1 1])
- XX
+ ZZ
```

Direct sums can be performed,

```jldoctest
julia> S"-XX" ⊗ S"ZZ"
- XX__
+ __ZZ
```

Indexing operations are available, including fancy indexing. Be careful about how phase information gets transferred during sub-indexing.

```jldoctest
julia> s = S"-XYZ
             -ZIX
             +XIZ";

julia> s[1]
- XYZ

julia> s[1,2]
(true, true)

julia> s[[3,1]]
+ X_Z
- XYZ

julia> s[[3,1],[2]]
+ _
- Y
```

Consistency at creation is not verified so nonsensical stabilizers can be
created, both in terms of content and shape.

```jldoctest
julia> S"iX
         +Z"
+iX
+ Z
```

Similarly to the Pauli operators, a bit array representation is used.

```jldoctest stab
julia> s = S"-XXX
             +ZZI
             -IZZ"
- XXX
+ ZZ_
- _ZZ

julia> s.phases, s.nqubits, s.xzs
(UInt8[0x02, 0x00, 0x02], 3, UInt64[0x0000000000000007 0x0000000000000000; 0x0000000000000000 0x0000000000000003; 0x0000000000000000 0x0000000000000006])
```

And there are convenience functions that can extract the corresponding binary
check matrix.

```jldoctest stab
julia> stab_to_gf2(s)
3×6 Matrix{Bool}:
 1  1  1  0  0  0
 0  0  0  1  1  0
 0  0  0  0  1  1
```

# [Canonicalization of Stabilizers](@id Canonicalization-of-Stabilizers)

Canonicalization (akin to Gaussian elimination over F(2,2)) is implemented in
the [`canonicalize!`](@ref) function.
Besides the default canonicalization prescription,
alternative ones are available as described in the
[canonicalization page](@ref Canonicalization-operations).

```jldoctest
julia> s = S"-XXX
             +ZZX
             +III";

julia> canonicalize!(s)
+ YY_
+ ZZX
+ ___
```

If phases are inconsequential, the operations can be faster by not tracking and
updating them.

```jldoctest
julia> s = S"-XXX
             +ZZX
             +III";

julia> canonicalize!(s; phases=false)
- YY_
+ ZZX
+ ___
```

These operations are in place (as customarily signified by "!").

```jldoctest
julia> s = S"-XXX
             +ZZX
             +III";

julia> canonicalize!(s; phases=false);

julia> s
- YY_
+ ZZX
+ ___
```

# [Projective Measurements](@id Projective-Measurements)

To observe the effect of different projections, we will start with a GHZ state.

```jldoctest proj
julia> s = S"-XXX
             +ZZI
             -IZZ";
```

The [`project!`](@ref) function returns the new stabilizer, the index where the
anticommutation was detected, and the result of the projection (`nothing` being
an undetermined result). For instance here we project on an operator that does
not commute with all stabilizer generators.

```jldoctest proj
julia> project!(copy(s), P"ZII")
(+ Z__
+ ZZ_
- _ZZ, 1, nothing)
```

Importantly, when there is an undetermined result, we return `nothing` **and
leave the phase of the new stabilizer the same as the phase of the projection
operator**. If you want to perform a Monte Carlo simulation, you need to
randomize the phase of the stabilizer at the anticommuting index yourself. For
instance, one can do:

```julia
newstate, anticomindex, result = project!(state, projector)
if isnothing(result)
    newstate.phases[anticomindex] = rand([0x0,0x2])
end
```

Or we can project on a commuting operator, hence no anticommuting terms (the
index is zero), and the result is perfectly determined (-1, or in our convention
to represent the phase, 0x2).

```jldoctest proj
julia> project!(copy(s), P"-ZZI")
(- XXX
- Z_Z
- _ZZ, 0, 0x02)
```

When the projection is consistent with the stabilizer (i.e. the measurement
result is not `nothing`), this would trigger an expensive canonicalization
procedure in order to calculate the measurement result (unless we are using more
advanced data structures to represent the state, which are discussed later). If
all you want to know is whether the projection is consistent with the
stabilizer, but you do not care about the measurement result, you can skip the
canonicalization and calculation of the result.

```jldoctest proj
julia> project!(copy(s), P"-ZZI", keep_result=false)
(- XXX
+ ZZ_
- _ZZ, 0, nothing)
```

Lastly, in either case, you can skip the calculation of the phases as well, if
they are unimportant.

```jldoctest proj
julia> project!(copy(s), P"ZZI", phases=false)
(- XXX
+ Z_Z
- _ZZ, 0, 0x00)
```

# [Partial Traces](@id Partial-Traces)

Partial trace (using [`traceout!`](@ref)) over even a single qubit might cause many of them to decohere due to entanglement.

```jldoctest
julia> ghz = S"XXX
               ZZ_
               _ZZ";

julia> traceout!(ghz, [1])
+ _ZZ
+ ___
+ ___
```

This is somewhat more elegant when the datastructure being used explicitly supports mixed states.

```jldoctest
julia> ghz = MixedStabilizer(S"XXX
                               ZZ_
                               _ZZ");

julia> traceout!(ghz, [1])
Rank 1 stabilizer
+ _ZZ
```


# [Generating a Pauli Operator with Stabilizer Generators](@id Generating-a-Pauli-Operator-with-Stabilizer-Generators)

The [`generate!`](@ref) function attempts to generate a Pauli operator by
multiplying together the operators belonging to a given stabilizer (or reports
their independence). This particular function requires the stabilizer to be
already canonicalized.

```jldoctest gen
julia> s = S"-XXX
             +ZZI
             -IZZ";

julia> s = canonicalize!(s)
- XXX
- Z_Z
- _ZZ
```

It modifies the Pauli operator in place, reducing it to identity if possible.
The leftover phase is present to indicate if the phase itself could not have
been canceled. The list of indices specifies which rows of the stabilizer were
used to generated the desired Pauli operator.

```jldoctest gen
julia> generate!(P"XYY", s)
(- ___, [1, 3])
```

Phases can be neglected, for higher performance.

```jldoctest gen
julia> generate!(P"XYY", s, phases=false)
(+ ___, [1, 3])
```

If the Pauli operator can not be generated by the stabilizer, `nothing` value is
returned.

```jldoctest gen
julia> generate!(P"ZZZ", s)

julia> generate!(P"XZX", s)

julia> generate!(P"YYY", s)
```

# [Clifford Operators](@id Clifford-Operators)

The [`CliffordOperator`](@ref) structure represents a linear mapping between
stabilizers (which should also preserve commutation relationships, but that is
not checked at instantiation). A number of predefined Clifford operators are
available.

```jldoctest
julia> Hadamard
X ⟼ + Z
Z ⟼ + X

julia> Phase
X ⟼ + Y
Z ⟼ + Z

julia> CNOT
X_ ⟼ + XX
_X ⟼ + _X
Z_ ⟼ + Z_
_Z ⟼ + ZZ

julia> CliffordId
X ⟼ + X
Z ⟼ + Z
```

Chaining and tensor products are possible. Same for qubit permutations.

```jldoctest
julia> Hadamard ⊗ Phase
X_ ⟼ + Z_
_X ⟼ + _Y
Z_ ⟼ + X_
_Z ⟼ + _Z

julia> Hadamard * Phase
X ⟼ - Y
Z ⟼ + X

julia> permute(CNOT, [2,1])
X_ ⟼ + X_
_X ⟼ + XX
Z_ ⟼ + ZZ
_Z ⟼ + _Z
```

You can create custom Clifford operators with C-strings or with a list of Pauli
operators.

```jldoctest
julia> C"-ZZ
         +_Z
         -X_
         +XX"
X_ ⟼ - ZZ
_X ⟼ + _Z
Z_ ⟼ - X_
_Z ⟼ + XX

julia> CliffordColumnForm([P"-ZZ", P"_Z", P"-X_", P"XX"])
X_ ⟼ - ZZ
_X ⟼ + _Z
Z_ ⟼ - X_
_Z ⟼ + XX
```

Naturally, the operators can be applied to stabilizer states. This includes high
performance in-place operations (and the phase can be neglected with
`phases=false` for faster computation).
For some uses, the alternative datastructure [`CliffordColumnForm`](@ref) might be more performant.

```jldoctest
julia> CNOT * S"X_"
+ XX

julia> s = S"X_";

julia> apply!(s,CNOT)
+ XX
```

Sparse applications where a small Clifford operator is applied only on a particular subset of a larger stabilizer is also possible.

```jldoctest
julia> s = S"Z_YX";

julia> apply!(s, CNOT, [4,2]) # Apply the CNOT on qubits 4 and 2
+ ZXYX
```

Pauli operators act as Clifford operators too (but they are rather boring, as
they only change signs).

```jldoctest
julia> P"XII" * S"ZXX"
- ZXX
```

# Destabilizers

Slightly abusing the name: What we call "destabilizers" here is a stabilizer and
its destabilizing operators saved together. They are implemented with the
[`Destabilizer`](@ref) object and are initialized from a stabilizer.

```jldoctest destab
julia> s=S"-XXX
           -ZZI
           +IZZ";

julia> d = Destabilizer(s)
+ Z__
+ _X_
+ __X
━━━━━
- XXX
- ZZ_
- Z_Z
```

They have convenience methods to extract only the stabilizer and destabilizer
pieces:

```jldoctest destab
julia> stabilizerview(d)
- XXX
- ZZ_
- Z_Z

julia> destabilizerview(d)
+ Z__
+ _X_
+ __X
```

Importantly commuting projections are much faster when tracking the destabilizer
as canonicalization is not necessary (an ``\mathcal{O}(n^2)`` complexity because it avoids
the expensive ``\mathcal{O}(n^3)`` canonicalization operation).

```jldoctest destab
julia> project!(d,P"ZZI")
(+ Z__
+ _X_
+ __X
━━━━━
- XXX
- ZZ_
- Z_Z, 0, 0x02)
```

Non-commuting projections are just as fast as when using only stabilizers.

```jldoctest destab
julia> project!(d,P"ZZZ")
(- XXX
+ X_X
+ XX_
━━━━━
+ ZZZ
- ZZ_
- Z_Z, 1, nothing)
```

Clifford operations can be applied the same way they are applied to stabilizers.

```jldoctest destab
julia> apply!(d,CNOT⊗Hadamard)
- X_Z
+ XXZ
+ X__
━━━━━
+ _ZX
- _Z_
- Z_X
```

# Mixed States

Both the `Stabilizer` and `Destabilizer` structures have more general forms
that enable work with mixed stabilizer states.
They are the [`MixedStabilizer`](@ref) and [`MixedDestabilizer`](@ref) structures,
described in [Mixed States](@ref Mixed-Stabilizer-States).
More information that can be seen in the [data structures page](@ref Choosing-Appropriate-Data-Structure),
which expands upon the algorithms available for each structure.
